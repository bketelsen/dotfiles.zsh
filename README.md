A collection of [@nickgerace](https://github.com/nickgerace)'s dotfiles and miscellaneous scripts.

## Shell Configuration

The dotfiles themselves assume that you running in one of the following environments with `zsh` as your shell:

- macOS amd64
- macOS arm64 (aarch64)
- Linux (GNU) amd64
- WSL2 Linux amd64

Execute `make` to get started.

> _Note: the shell configuration does not use `oh-my-zsh`._
> _Only `zsh` needs to be installed as everything is configured manually._

## Disclaimer

Scripts not recently in use may be out of date.
This is a "living" repository, meaning that scripts and dotfiles more frequently in use will be more likely to be kept up to date.
Anything not recently or frequently in use will be removed from the repository (eventually).
